# RECIPE-HUB

## Preamble
This is the initial implementation of a crazy idea to track cooking recipes using the tools offered by Github. I've been keeping a journal at home of recipes that I try and any notes I have of the implementation (taste, changes in technique, substitutions, etc.). It hit me that Github *could* be a useful tool to track these implementations and recipe tweaks. We'll see where this goes. 

## Standards of Presentation

Where possible, recipes will conform to these standards:
   - Original recipe will be properly referenced, and presented with original weights and measurements.
   - Personal trials of recipes will be recorded by weight (grams, whereever possible). 
   - Measurements are performed with the following equipment, unless otherwise stated:
      - Jennings CJ-4000 Compact Digital Weigh Scale (+/-0.5 g)
      - American Weigh Scales Black Blade Digital Pocket Scale, BL-1KG-BLK 1000 (+/-0.1 g)
      - Classic Super-Fast® Thermapen® (+/- 0.7 deg F)
   - Basic tasting notes should be included with each iteration, but knowing me I'll probably forget.
   - In addition, as a tracking attempt, a rating out of an arbitrary 10 should be included.
